## Simulating Multilevel-FeedBack-Scheduling-Queue-in-C++- 

This application implements Multilevel Feedback Queue in C++ with two levels:
Level 1 : Fixed priority preemptive Scheduling
Level 2 : Round Robin Scheduling

 
 ## SYSTEM DETAILS 

### 1. Fixed priority preemptive Scheduling (Queue 1)
 * Priority 0 is highest priority.
 * Quantum : 4 unit time
 * Preemptive:
If one process e.g. P1 is scheduled and running , now another process with higher priority comes e.g. P2. New process(high priority)
process P2 preempts currently running process P1 and process P1 will go to second level queue.

### 2. Round Robin Scheduling (Queue 2)
* Quantum : 4 unit time
* All the processes in second level queue will complete their execution according to round robin scheduling.
* Queue 2 will be processed after Queue 1 becomes empty.
* Priority of Queue 2 has lower priority than in Queue 1.


Suppose Queue 1 is empty and currently process from Queue 2 is being executed. Now, If at this time a new process arrives then new process will be part of Queue 1. So, new
process should be scheduled as Queue 1 has higher priority than Queue 2. Again after Queue 1 becomes empty Queue 2 will resume execution.

 
## INPUT FORMAT
